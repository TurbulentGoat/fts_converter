FTS to PNG, TIFF, JPG, or BMP.  
If you adjust any of the settings, hit preview and it will show you an updated preview of the selected image (or the first image in the batch you selected.)  
Auto normalise is usually a good start for RAW files because:  
1) It finds the minimum and maximum values, determines the lowest and highest pixel values in your image, and rescales the data.  
2) It subtracts the minimum value from each pixel and scales the result so that the maximum value maps to 255.  
This remapping brings the full range of data into the standard 8-bit display range (0â€“255).
